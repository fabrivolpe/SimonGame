## Project Status
Completed

## Room for Improvement
Showing entire pattern every time the player clicks "next level." Also, prevent a player from clicking "next level" until he or she is done with the current level. However, that would take the opportunity away from trying to memorize larger patterns at once.

This game is based on a tutorial by The London App Brewery.
